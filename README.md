# boulderbuzzer - Buzzers that can be mounted to a portable boulder wall

This repository contains information, source code, pcb designs, assembly instructions, etc for building the following buzzers:


Those buzzers are designed around hollow M10 bolts that can be used to simultaneously mount the buzzer to a (in my case portable) boulder wall whilst allowing power cables to pass through the back and neatly hidden away.


## Buzzer

The buzzer subdirectory contains some docs, the pcb design, the source code, some 3d-printable files and a few words about assembly and disassembly for/of an individual buzzer.

## Station

The station subdirectory contains the documentation and source code for the base station to which all buzzers connect.
